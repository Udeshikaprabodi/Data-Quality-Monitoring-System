# Data Quality Monitoring System

## Project Description

This project is designed to monitor and report on the quality of data within an organization. It identifies common data issues such as missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies, and outliers in a dataset. The system automates the process of data quality checks using Python and Apache Airflow. It ensures the integrity of the data, providing valuable insights into potential issues that could affect the quality of analysis and decision-making.

### Objectives:
- Understand the importance of data quality.
- Implement checks and balances for data integrity.
- Generate automated reports on data quality issues.
  
### Skills:
- Data quality assessment and reporting
- Data automation using Apache Airflow
- Python for data analysis and quality checks

### Tools & Technologies:
- **Python**: For performing data quality checks such as detecting missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- **Apache Airflow**: For automating the data quality checks on a scheduled basis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **SQL**: For querying data when integrated into a database.

## Features:
- **Missing values detection**: Identifies missing or null values in the dataset.
- **Duplicate detection**: Finds and counts duplicate records in the data.
- **Inconsistencies check**: Checks for logical inconsistencies like extreme temperature values.
- **Outlier detection**: Identifies outliers in key fields, such as wind speed.
